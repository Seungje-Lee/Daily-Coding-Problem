### Problem

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given <span style='background-color: #F7DDBE'>[10, 15, 3, 7]</span> and <span style='background-color: #F7DDBE'>k</span> of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.


### Process

Brute-Force Search might be the easiest way(thinking of the idea or implementation, whatever) to solve this problem, but it's time complexity is **O(N^2)**.
